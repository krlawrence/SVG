<h2>Script and SVG used to count letters and draw a graph</h2>
Type some text into the entry field and click <b>Update</b> to see a bar graph representing the 
distribution of letters used in the text. Note that upper and lower case letters are treated the same.

IT WAS the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of
foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of
Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we
had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all
going direct the other way- in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of
its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative
degree of comparison only.

There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the throne of England; there
were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the throne of France. In both
countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes, that
things in general were settled for ever.

It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.  Spiritual revelations were
conceded to England at that favoured period, as at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her
five-and-twentieth blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had heralded the
sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were made for the swallowing up of London and
Westminster. Even the Cock-lane ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out
its messages, as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally deficient in originality)
rapped out theirs. Mere messages in the earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown
and People, from a congress of British subjects in America: which, strange to relate, have proved
more important to the human race than any communications yet received through any of the chickens of
the Cock-lane brood.

France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her sister of the shield and
trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down hill, making paper money and spending it. Under the
guidance of her Christian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane achievements
as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue torn out with pincers, and his body
burned alive, because he had not kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of
monks which passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty yards. It is likely enough
that, rooted in the woods of France and Norway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put
to death, already marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into boards, to make a
certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in it, terrible in history. It is likely enough
that in the rough outhouses of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were
sheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with rustic mire, snuffed about by
pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which the Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrils
of the Revolution. But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work unceasingly, work silently and
no one heard them as they went about with muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any
suspicion that they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous.
