    <h3>About these examples</h3>
    <p>SVG, short for "Scalable Vector Graphics", is an XML markup
      language designed for bringing 2D artwork and drawings to the Web
      and other places. As well as vector graphics (lines, circles,
      paths, etc.) SVG supports text, images, animation, scripting,
      colors, gradients, filter effects and many other things. It is a
      very rich (declarative) graphics language which can be just as
      easily hand coded or machine generated. </p>
    <p>Back in 1998/9 and the years following I became very active in
      the SVG community. As far as I know, I was the author of the first
      known SVG rendering engine back then which I wrote in Java using
      the new (at the time) Java 2D API. I was also a very active member
      of the SVG Working group at W3C that produced the <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG10/"> SVG 1.0 Specification</a>.
      Over the years I have compiled a large collection of my own SVG
      test cases and examples and used them in lectures about SVG at
      various conferences around the World. The recent adoption of SVG
      by the major Web browsers, both on traditional desktop computers
      and on mobile devices, as well as many people asking me about my
      examples has prompted me to collect all of my material into one
      place.If you ever attended one of my talks on SVG over the years
      you may already have some of these but this is the first time I
      have tried to collect everything into one place.<br>
    </p>
    <p>These examples are not meant to be works of art, I would by no
      means claim to be an artist. I view them more as a learning aid.
      You will find most of the major SVG features used somewhere in
      these files. If you are interested in learning a bit more about
      the power and ease of use of SVG, I encourage you to look at the
      source for the files as well as the "artwork" as some pictures may
      look the same but might have been created using different SVG
      techniques behind the scenes! </p>
    <p>With a few exceptions, all of the examples were either hand coded
      (by me) or produced using Ruby scripts that I wrote to generate
      SVG output. One or two of the examples were produced using
      Inkscape. </p>
    <p> Anyway, I hope that this material is of interest and useful. I
      certainly had fun walking down memory lane while putting it
      together.<br>
